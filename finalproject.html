                <p class="lead"> I am currently a student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology coming to the end of my second year.
                I am studying Information Technology and working on finishing my Bachelor's Degree. I am a very outgoing person who loves anything technology related, which
                is also a large reason why I chose to study in this field. I have maintained a GPA over 3.0 for my last 2 years as a college student.</p>
                <p class="lead"> I am student who puts a lot of focus into school work, but tries to work as much as I able to. For over a year now I have been
                tutoring students of various different ages in several math courses as a job on the side. This works well with my student life because it gives me flexible hours to
                balance with all my student life and homework from classes. As of right now I am in the midst of looking for internships in my field of study to get more
                hands on experience outside of classes.</p>

                <h4 id="section2">What Content did I learn in IS117?</h4>
                <p>This class has taught me the multiple web designing utilities and different useful techniques with developing.
                I learned to understand and use HTML, JavaScript, CSS. I learned how to use Webstorm as a building block for creating
                repositories. Also, this class taught me the basics of Linux and Github.</p>

                <h4>What Other Things did I Learn?</h4>
                <p>Not only was this class useful in teaching me different developing tools and how to use them, it gave me more of an
                understand of technology. Throughout the semster I learned the history of the internet and how it all originally started. In addition,
                I learned how to keep myself safer online and the reality of how our information can be used by others. One last major thing that this course
                helped me understand was how to work with code with a partner on a project and properly collaborate to be successful.</p>

                <h4 id="section3">What Skills do I Know? </h4>
                <p>As shown on the right and previously stated, I am well adapt in working with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                I can work easily with CSS files to make a web page more fluent and stylish than average. Programming languages
                that I know as of now are Java and Python, which I can make running and working programs in.</p>
                <p>In addition to those, I am well informed in working with Linux and the basic commands. I am highly efficient in using
                Webstorm with creating repositories. I am able to understand all the features of it and create branches to collaborate with
                other people. Also, I use Github frequently and can work with it easily to create repositories and link them to Webstorm so
                that I may push files there later on.</p>
